# Facebook Customer Profiling With Python
In order to better understand our customers and those interested in our products, we need to know what their interests are. By targeting ads and promotions to the right people, we can more effectively reach our target audience and improve our communication with them. This can also aid in creating a clearer and more defined customer persona.
